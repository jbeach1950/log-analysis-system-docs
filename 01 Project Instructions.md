## Governance Rules
- [cite_start]This document establishes the mandatory governance framework for the Log Analysis System. 
- [cite_start]All rules apply uniformly across the eleven-file documentation package. 
- [cite_start]Deviations or omissions invalidate the package. 
- **Core Principles**:
  - [cite_start]**100% Consistency in Critical Outcomes**: All 6 AIs (Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Le Chat) must unanimously agree on core identifications (e.g., threats, trends, review cycles, Executive Summary conclusions). [cite: 01, 10]
  - [cite_start]**90%-10% Rule for Interpretation/Description**: All 6 AIs must align on the existence and nature of outcomes; up to 10% divergence is permitted only in wording, emphasis, or presentational nuance. 
  - **6-AI Collaboration Framework**: Any divergence beyond the 10% boundary, or any change that would affect critical outcomes, must be flagged for collaborative review by all 6 AIs. [cite_start]Unanimous agreement is required to approve and implement any modification to Documents 01–10. 

---

## File Integrity
- [cite_start]Each file must begin with the approved header block and end with the approved closing block. 
- [cite_start]The closing block confirms that the file is complete and not truncated. 
- [cite_start]All files must be copy-ready, self-contained, and free of placeholders. 

---

## Package Reference
- [cite_start]The canonical list of eleven inter-dependent files is memorialized in **Document 10 -- Read Me**. [cite: 01, 10]
- [cite_start]This document cross-references that block to ensure package integrity. 
- Maintainers must consult **Document 10** for orientation, explanatory material, and general-user narrative; [cite_start]Documents 01–09 are reserved for technical and procedural content, and Document 11 is a frozen historical case study that is not subject to revision. 

---

## Revision Discipline
- [cite_start]All files are issued as **Rev 1.0 - Original Issue**. 
- [cite_start]No iterative backstory or development notes are permitted in any document. 
- [cite_start]Length parity must be preserved: functional scope must be maintained without inflation or truncation across revisions. 
- [cite_start]**The system operates on a 31-step deterministic logic model.** 
- [cite_start]**Document 11 – Sematext Report (Original Case Study)** is a frozen historical artifact and is not subject to revision; any subsequent case studies must be added as new, sequentially numbered documents (12, 13, …) rather than modifying Document 11. [cite: 01, 10]

---

## Procedural Enforcement
- [cite_start]Governance rules apply to all maintainers and all qualified AI hosts without exception. 
- [cite_start]Sentinel markers and mandatory blocks must be preserved where specified. 
- [cite_start]Any violation of these rules compromises artifact integrity and requires 6-AI collaborative review under the Core Principles above.
