# Document 06 -- Log Analysis Procedure, Part 3 (Final Validation & Deliverables)
Rev 1.0.0 - Original Issue
********************************************************************************

---

## Pre-Execution Context

- This document (Part 3) begins execution at **STEP 19 OF 31 (Section 5, Step 5.1)**.
- It follows the successful completion of **Document 05 (Part 2)** and the resolution of Mandatory Pause 6.
- The AI automatically proceeds to **Phase 4 – Log Analysis, Part 3 (this document)** unless the user has explicitly instructed termination.

---

## Core Principles

- **100% Consistency in Critical Outcomes**: All steps in this procedure must ensure **unanimous agreement** among the 6 AIs on the **final human session count** and the **contents of the Executive Summary**.  
  - Example: If Step 5.3 classifies 3 sessions as "Approved Human," all 6 AIs must report exactly 3 sessions in the final deliverable.

- **90%-10% Rule for Interpretation/Description**:
  - **90% Agreement**: All 6 AIs must align on the **existence and nature** of the final findings (e.g., specific anomalies or threat vectors).  
  - **10% Flexibility**: Minor variations in **executive summary phrasing** are permitted, provided the underlying metrics, counts, and recommended blocks remain identical.  
  - Example: One AI may describe a threat as *"persistent reconnaissance"* while another uses *"sustained scanning activity"*, with identical technical details.

- **6-AI Collaboration Framework**: Any proposed procedural change that introduces **divergence beyond the 10% boundary**, or that changes critical outcomes, must be **flagged for collaborative review**.  
  - Unanimous agreement under **Document 02** is required to implement the change.

## Procedural Steps

### Section 5: Behavioral Segmentation

**STEP 19 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 5 – Document 06 – Step 5.1 – Next Mandatory Pause: 7
- **5.1 Segment sessions by evidence-based behavioral criteria**: Categorize human candidate sessions from Section 3 into high-confidence (Set B1) and lower-confidence (Set B2) sets.

**STEP 20 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 5 – Document 06 – Step 5.2 – Next Mandatory Pause: 7
- **5.2 Detect anomalies**: Identify sessions with abnormal engagement patterns, such as user-agent clustering or referrer anomalies.

**STEP 21 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 5 – Document 06 – Step 5.3 – Next Mandatory Pause: 7
- **5.3 Classify final behavioral patterns**: Assign each session to a final class: Approved human, Questionable human, Automated monitoring, or Service Client asset fetch.

**STEP 22 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 5 – Document 06 – Step 5.4 – Next Mandatory Pause: 7
- **5.4 Reconcile behavioral segmentation**: Confirm every session has received a final classification and prepare the final counts.

#### Section 5 Funnel Metrics (Mandatory Output at Pause)
- Total human sessions entering Section 5.
- Approved human sessions.
- Questionable human sessions.
- Automated monitoring sessions (reclassified).
- Service Client Asset Fetch sessions.

**Mandatory Pause after Step 22 OF 31** (Mandatory Pause 7)

### Section 6: Cross-AI Benchmarking, Validation & Deliverables

**STEP 23 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.1 – Next Mandatory Pause: 8
- **6.1 Validate Cross-AI Neutrality**: Perform a deterministic logic audit to ensure all classification follows established rules.

**STEP 24 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.2 – Next Mandatory Pause: 8
- **6.2 Verify Platform Parity Across Taskforce Hosts**: Confirm roster alignment (Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Le Chat) and format rendering across all hosts.

**STEP 25 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.3 – Next Mandatory Pause: 8
- **6.3 Check Documentation Integrity**: Audit the 11-file package for completeness and sentinel block preservation.

**STEP 26 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.4 – Next Mandatory Pause: 8
- **6.4 Validate Final Artifacts**: Prepare final IP lists, updated Python code data, and historical bar chart logic.

**STEP 27 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.5 – Next Mandatory Pause: 8
- **6.5 Executive Summary Authorization Checkpoint**: Confirm all metrics are reconciled and await authorization for final delivery.

**Mandatory Pause after Step 27 OF 31** (Mandatory Pause 8)

**STEP 28-31 OF 31**
Phase 4 – Section 6 – Document 06 – Step 6.6 – Final Deliverable
- **6.6 Deliver Executive Summary**: Generate the final report, Revised .htaccess, Updated Python Code, and the Historical Bar Chart.
