# Contributing to log-analysis-system-docs

Thanks for your interest in this project. This repository documents a log analysis system that reconstructs human sessions and exposes stealth operations from Apache access logs using multi‑AI forensic methods.

At this stage the project is documentation‑first. Contributions that improve clarity, rigor, and reproducibility are especially welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- Improve wording, structure, or examples in the documentation.
- Propose additional case studies or analysis techniques.
- Report mistakes, omissions, or unclear sections.
- Suggest small workflow improvements for working with the data logs.

If you are unsure whether an idea fits, open an issue and describe what you have in mind.

## Before you start

- Read the main README to understand the scope and goals of the project.
- Skim Documents 1–11 to see how the methodology and case studies fit together.
- For data‑related work, review the notes that accompany the `data-logs/` directory.

## Reporting issues

Use GitHub Issues for:

- Documentation errors (typos, broken links, incorrect claims).
- Ambiguous or confusing explanations.
- Questions about how to apply the described methods to your own logs.

When filing an issue, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title.
- The document and section (for example, `Doc 03`, “Session Reconstruction”).
- A short description of the problem and, if possible, a suggested fix.

## Proposing changes

For small fixes (typos, minor rewording):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your change.
3. Edit the relevant `.md` file(s).
4. Open a pull request with a short explanation of what you changed and why.

For larger changes (new sections, new case studies):

- Open an issue first and outline your proposal.
- Wait for feedback before investing heavily in drafting.

## Style and scope

- Keep the tone precise, neutral, and forensic rather than speculative.
- Favor concrete examples based on real or realistically simulated log data.
- Preserve the numbered document structure (Docs 1–11) and existing revision scheme.

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful, constructive, and professional in all interactions. Disagreement about methods is fine; personal attacks are not. If any interaction makes you uncomfortable, you can contact the maintainer via GitHub to discuss the situation privately.
